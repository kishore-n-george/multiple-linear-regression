## General Information

The Bike sharing company wants to know:
- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- How well those variables describe the bike demands


## Conclusions
- As per our final Model, the top 3 predictor variables that influences the bike booking positively are:
  - Year
  - Winter
  - Temperature

- The predictor that influences the bike booking negatively
  - Light Snow
